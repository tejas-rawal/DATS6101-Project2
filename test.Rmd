## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# create matrix with 4 columns and 4 rows
stuff <- matrix(c(1:16), ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)

# specify the column names and row names of matrix
colnames(stuff) = c('TMAX model','Regressors','$R^2$','p-value of F-statistic')
rownames(stuff) <- c('LM1','LM2','LM3','LM4')

stuff
```

`stuff tuff`
